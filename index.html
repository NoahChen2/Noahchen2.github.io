<h1>The Life Jacket Mission</h1>
<p>WHO WE ARE:\nThe Life Jacket Mission is a non-profit organization that strives for increased water safety of individuals especially younger children. We are a group of avid teenagers that swims competitively year round in an indoor pool and also practices in the lake in the summer. On many occasions, we have witnessed young children without lifejackets in boats, kayak or paddle boards in the lake despite the fact that it is required by state law. We believe that wearing life jackets while boating is as important as driving a car with a seat belt or wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle or a motorcycle. Life jackets simply save lives. That was the main reason and motivation for the formation of the Life Jacket Mission.</p>
